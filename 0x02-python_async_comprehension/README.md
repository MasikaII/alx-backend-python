# Python - Async Comprehension
An async comprehension is an asynchronous version of a classical comprehension. Asyncio supports two types of asynchronous comprehensions, 
they are the “async for” comprehension and the “await” comprehension.
Comprehensions allow data collections like lists, dicts, and sets to be created in a concise way.
An asynchronous comprehension allows a list, set, or dict to be created using the “async for” expression with an asynchronous iterable. 
The “async for” expression may only be used within coroutines and tasks.
