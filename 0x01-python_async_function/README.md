# Python Async
Writing sequential (or synchronous) code is familiar to many programmers, even when they’re just getting started. 
It’s the kind of code that is executed one line at a time, one instruction at a time.

In the asynchronous world, the occurrence of events are independent of the main program flow. 
This means that actions are executed in the background, without waiting for the completion of the previous action.

In other words, the lines of code are executed concurrently.
