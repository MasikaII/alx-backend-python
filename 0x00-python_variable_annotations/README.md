# Variable Annotations
Variable Annotation is basically an enhancement of type hinting, which was introduced in Python 3.5. 
The full explanation behind Variable Annotation is explained in PEP 526.
Type hinting in Python is basically declaring that the parameters in your functions and methods have a certain type. 
Python does not enforce the type "hints," but you can use tools like mypy to enforce the type hints in much the same way 
that C++ enforces type declarations at runtime.
